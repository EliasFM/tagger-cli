Who wouldn't be proud to call him our great leader, he's been working hard to Make America Greater than it already is.\n\nHe works tirelessly, day and night, to ensure we're all safe and secure, we know our president is doing everything he can to help us all. He's a great Christian man, admires The Sermon On The Mount, and he attends church regularly and prays that he can be worthy of this honor bestowed upon him. \n\nOther countries love him and can't wait for him to visit their country too and bring his ideas. He was magnificent during the recent natural disasters when he and the First Lady were out there on the front lines of peoples despair, hugging the people, giving them assurance that he was doing everything he could to help them and their families rebuild and try to put their shattered lives together again. \n\nDay after day he was out there, offering his assistance, a shoulder to cry on, anything he could do to offer his assistance to those who lost so much. He's brought a great deal of security to our hard working men and women serving in the armed forces. He shares meals with them, asks them insightful questions about the jobs they perform. \n\nOur service people know he's there for them, he truly cares. He spends time at homeless shelters to try to understand their lives a little better, he spends time with homeless veterans and truly cares about all Americans. \n\nOur president spends a lot of time really studying the issues and frequently consults with experts in their fields of expertise and especially scientists so he can make informed choices. He is so charismatic. He's obviously adored by his brilliant wife and his two daughters. He's a great guy, too. \n\nObama will be remembered as one of the greatest presidents in history🇺🇸",
