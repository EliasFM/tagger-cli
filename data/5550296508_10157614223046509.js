      "message": "DON’T FALL FOR THE NET NEUTRALITY LIE\nEditorial by Kevin Ryan\n\n“The subject of “Net Neutrality” has been in the news recently, with word that the FCC may reverse the Obama-era policy.  Many people, even those who favor free markets and are wary of government intervention, have hopped onboard the net neutrality bandwagon. \n\nUnfortunately it’s a lesson in political deception.\n\n“Net Neutrality” purportedly protects internet consumers from internet service providers who would “throttle”, or slow, the internet for customers who paid less or were politically unfavorable.  But, when the Obama Administration imposed the new rules on internet providers, it was a solution in search of a problem: ISPs weren’t engaging in the conduct that government created regulations to protect us from.\n\nBut even if internet service providers did charge more to customers who used more bandwidth, there’s nothing wrong with that.  It’d be no different than charging someone who buys 300 items more than someone who buys 3 items.  It’s completely warranted.  And forcing companies to charge less than market price is downright socialist, and destroys, not protects, markets.\n\nAnd net neutrality, a.k.a. the 2015 Open Internet Order, is far more weighty than just a rule forbidding internet fast lanes.  The order’s reclassification of the internet as a public telecommunications utility put it under Title II regulation, the exact same order that stifled telecommunication innovation for nearly a hundred years and resulted in monopolies like Bell.\n\nAnd, no, ISPs are NOT a monopoly.  Most areas have numerous options for data/internet, including cellular, satellite, and cable.  As cable companies are learning the hard way, “cable cutting” has become more and more common.  The American consumer does not need government “protection” from predatory internet providers... the market is working just fine.  Companies who overcharge are bleeding customers.  \n\nWhen you tell the private sector how much it has to charge or who it must or must not enter into customer agreements with, it stifles innovation.  Only when a buyer and seller are fully free to decide the terms of sale do both parties benefit.  It’s a lesson learned through literally decades of socialism vs. capitalism competition.  (And for those who haven’t been paying attention, capitalism won.)\n\nIndeed there’s been a decrease in domestic broadband capital expenditures among the nation’s 12 largest ISPs since net neutrality was implemented, and smaller ISPs have reported that the Title II regulations are holding them back them from expanding new services.\n\nThe real reason “Net Neutrality” is a thing is because, as with Obamacare and countless other regulations, it puts politicians in charge of yet another sector of the economy.  And such power grabs encourage lobbyists to give even more money to the politicians that hold their companies’ fates in their hands.  It’s an age-old political trick that has resulted in the establishment of an uber-wealthy governing elite in America.  There’s a reason the D.C. suburbs have become the wealthiest in America.\n\nThe reality is, it’s things like “net neutrality” that result in the Washington elite consolidating more power over us.  Don’t fall for it.”",

As a result of this decision, wherever you live, the FCC is giving the green light for a single company to own the newspaper and multiple television and radio stations in your community\" (opening) \"floodgates to more consolidation.\" Rosenworcel said.\n\nBroadcasters have long argued they need greater scale to compete with cable and internet companies for advertising dollars. The most dramatic change was the FCC loosening media ownership rules in place since 1975. Under these changes, broadcasters could combine with a newspaper in the same market. They also could own two of the top four stations in any city. The new rules will likely be challenged in court, but if they survive, they are a significant change in media ownership regulations and could lead to further consolidation. The changes come as the FCC considers whether to allow the $3.9 billion merger of Trump-supporting Sinclair Media Group and Tribune Media, which would give the organization unparalleled control over local TV stations across the country.\n\nThe FCC also moved to relax regulations required phone companies like AT&T and Verizon to maintain their old copper infrastructure. The Democrats point out that the rule changes mean phone companies could leave consumers without service that's at least as good as their old copper networks, which provide traditional phone and DSL broadband service. But Pai has said getting rid of these regulations will remove barriers for phone companies to upgrade their networks to fiber infrastructure, which will allow for faster broadband service. The proposal would also eliminate a year-old nationwide approval process that makes it easier for phone and broadband companies to offer the subsidized service, and it would cut off subsidies to phone companies that resell service, such as wireless.",

      "message": "Since I am not knowledgeable about the subject I asked David who is very knowledgeable and this is his opinion:\nNet neutrality is a complicated issue with no easy or definitive conclusion on a single side. Take for example the case of Netflix and Comcast prior to net neutrality. Comcast claimed Netflix was sending more data than it was receiving thus creating an imbalance in peering relationship with the provider for Netflix. Comcast demanded more money from Netflix in return they would provide higher level of access on their network. This is good for customers with lower bandwidth, they are still able to subscribe to Netflix and get reasonable downloads, more business for Netflix, more income for Comcast. This is also bad because you are essentially putting a toll on the internet, pay us this fee or we don’t carry your traffic. This could cause rates to go up for Netflix. On one hand you have the ability to pay for better service on the other you may be charged for access you take for granted. I would err on the side of keeping net neutrality but am interested to see how the industry will react to the change.",
