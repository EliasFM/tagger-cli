Photo: Zach Gibson/Bloomberg News\nBy The Editorial Board\nNov. 23, 2017 2:35 p.m. ET\n144 COMMENTS\n\nAnyone who thought Thanksgiving would include several days of comity and goodwill toward fellow countrymen has been disabused, and one holiday brawl has been about “net neutrality” rules that the Federal Communications Commission plans to repeal. The political outrage doesn’t match the underlying merits, which is a return to the free internet that reigned for 20 years.\n\nFCC Chairman Ajit Pai this week announced a plan to unwind the Obama Administration’s 2015 “open internet” order that classified the web as a public utility like a telephone monopoly. This allowed the agency to impose price controls, though the FCC claimed it would “forbear.” Broadband network investment dipped 5.6% in the following two years, as Mr. Pai noted this week in our pages, and one reason is the uncertainty about government micromanagement.\n\nMr. Pai’s order will abandon euphemisms like the internet “conduct standard,” which allows the agency to go after behavior it doesn’t like, even if consumers disagree. One example are unlimited data plans that for some reason offended the FCC’s sensibilities, though the offerings are popular and give customers more of what they want.\n\nThe move will also remove a ban on “paid prioritization,” which is jargon for the strange idea that a service provider cannot speed up some content for a price—the same way Amazon requires you to pay extra for one-day delivery. Mr. Pai deserves particular credit for this move, not least because the left will be apoplectic about “protecting consumers” and selling out to Big Cable.\n\nThe irony is that the cable companies don’t care much about the ban, but content providers and entrepreneurs may be willing to pay more to get their stuff in front of more eyes faster. For instance: The Obama rule all but blocks telemedical innovation that could allow real-time tracking of patients if the data could be first in line. The left’s odd position is that emergency alerts deserve the same priority as pornography.\n\nThe practical effect of Mr. Pai’s order is restoring the status quo before 2015, which no one remembers as a dystopia. The Federal Trade Commission will have enforcement authority over privacy issues and deceptive practices, which was the norm before the Obama crowd intervened. The Justice Department retains jurisdiction over antitrust concerns. The FCC order will also require companies that engage in paid prioritization, throttling or other network practices to disclose this information. The FTC will then have a clear standard for misleading behavior.\n\nOne of the more hilarious objections is that the nefarious Mr. Pai is rolling out his plan during the holidays to sneak it by the public, as if that were possible amid the organized activist outcry. The irony is that Mr. Pai declined to kill the Obama rules by decree and instead initiated a notice and comment process that is the normal procedure of government. The text of the order will be available to the public several weeks ahead of a vote scheduled for mid-December.\n\nThis open process is a notable contrast with Tom Wheeler, Mr. Obama’s FCC Chairman. Mr. Wheeler prepared one net neutrality order but dumped it when President Obama called for tougher regulations in a YouTube video. Mr. Wheeler then hoisted up a 300-page draft for a vote without any public scrutiny.\n\nReaders may now wonder why they are hearing claims that the Comcast customer service department will soon rule the internet. This line is a classic case of rent-seeking from internet companies like Netflix, which want to limit how much they have to pay to stream movies that suck up a lot of bandwidth. The real story is that, thanks to new leadership at the FCC, this week a few tech giants in Silicon Valley lost to American consumers who will benefit from more innovation and choice online.",

As of right now you pay your electric company and every electrical socket in your house provides the same amount of energy. So an electrical socket can provide electricity for a TV, cable box, blender, saw, and it will function. Now let's say the electric company wants to charge you according to rooms so let's say they'll sell you a basic package that will provide electricity for light bulbs and lamps throughout your house. But if you need more energy than they can sell you a living room package to power your TV cable box and stereo system now let's say you need a kitchen package to provide you with your refrigerator, blender, coffee maker, and anything else you need in the kitchen and let's say they can sell you a garage package that provides electricity to run all your equipment in a garage. By the time you add all those packages up electricity bill will be way more expensive. Net neutrality will work in the same way they can sell you a basic package that allow you to check emails but if you want more bandwidth then they can sell you a movie package or a sports package or a gaming package and your internet bill could Skyrocket. Getting rid of net neutrality is not good for the consumer but good for business",

Rather than a long-standing set of rules that have protected innovators, it is a recently articulated idea that threatens innovation. Rather than a tool to introduce competition in a monopoly market, it would discourage competition in what is now a dynamic marketplace.\nThese and other misconceptions obscure the lack of a compelling case for FCC regulation, and the dangers to Americans that such regulation would pose.\n—James L.

      "message": "Boy, there are a lot of people confused in this comments section. To be clear, net neutrality currently exists and it is the regulations put in place by the Obama administration. If those regulations are removed there would no longer be net neutrality. Net neutrality simply put means that you have the wide ranging freedom to surf whatever you wish and that your internet service provider can't stop you from doing it. Can't slow down access to certain websites or begin charging for selective access or bundling, in much the way your tv cable is bundled. Net neutrality is a good thing. The regulations insuring it remains are a good thing. Sometimes regulating something IS a good thing even if you didn't like that a liberal government imposed it. Net neutrality maintains your freedom on the internet. Getting rid of the regulation and allowing ISP's to charge differently depending on package or slow down access to websites IS A BAD THING. The internet works perfectly under net neutrality. I would suggest you all fight very hard to insure that the current net neutrality legislation remain in place. Parsing out the internet by doing away with the current legislation is dangerously bad for democracy. There are plenty that will try to confuse this issue. I would suggest some of the Russian trolls are hard at work on it trying to persuade people to do away with this legislation. It would help them to divide the country even more than it already is. Keep the status quo. Net neutrality good. (Copied from a friend’s post...)",

If those regulations are removed there would no longer be net neutrality. Net neutrality simply put means that you have the wide ranging freedom to surf whatever you wish and that your internet service provider can't stop you from doing it. Can't slow down access to certain websites or begin charging for selective access or bundling, in much the way your tv cable is bundled. Net neutrality is a good thing. The regulations insuring it remains are a good thing. Sometimes regulating something IS a good thing even if you didn't like that a liberal government imposed it. Net neutrality maintains your freedom on the internet. Getting rid of the regulation and allowing ISP's to charge differently depending on package or slow down access to websites IS A BAD THING. The internet works perfectly under net neutrality. I would suggest you all fight very hard to insure that the current net neutrality legislation remain in place. Parsing out the internet by doing away with the current legislation is dangerously bad for democracy. There are plenty that will try to confuse this issue. I would suggest some of the Russian trolls are hard at work on it trying to persuade people to do away with this legislation. It would help them to divide the country even more than it already is. Keep the status quo. Net neutrality good.",

So for the government to allow them another company creates a Monopoly.

And you get charged for those uses individually... \nSo now to use the internet under \"neutrality\" you'll pay 100 plus at the minimum... that JUST FOR INTERNET USE\nWhere on average it's around 40.00ish dollars a month.\n\nOh yeah and let's not forget you loss your God given right for free speech... expression... exploration of open knowledge... basicly they get to tell you what see.
