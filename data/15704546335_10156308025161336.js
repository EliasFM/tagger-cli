It's been going on for to long.\n\nThey just reported the Big boys just approved another huge increase in Flood Insurance, That rates will skyrocket again. Others call it a slush fund - amazing where all that money on our expense goes. \n\nAmazing what you can find on Social Media ones taken advantage of others.\n\nStrange when certain Government Agency's won't help, or ones who ask for help have their post deleted & blocked by them. \n\nMany of us don't have anything left, the News Media reported that 50% States Citizens forced into financial debt. \n\nStrange what you can find on Social media being reported. Many of us agree, that had the same thing happen to us. \n\nShame when many taken advantage of by other's.\n\nMany seniors, many disabled citizens & many working for less being taken advantage of living on less. \n\nGod help us...\n\nMany living in older homes call it fraud. Amazing who won't help ones living on less. \nThey talk about ones being taken advantage of. Who helps those needing help?\n\nStrange when they reported FEMA billions in debt, so they are going to raise Flood Insurance going up again 25%. \n\n2 years ago Flood Insurance went up almost 50%.\n\nAmazing how many thousands they said applied for FEMA because they \"couldn't afford\" Insurance. Even worse how many in older homes having their House Insurance policy' s being cancelled by their House Insurance Companies. \nStrange many told me they had the same thing happened to them. Even ones who Insurance Companys refuse to take on any new Policys during season. \n\nStrange how many who turned in a new Wind Mitigation Inspection Report, then their Insurance Companies ended their credits & big discount, took away their Wind Mitigation Inspection Report. \n\nThose policy's went up $1000.00 Then they took that first payment from $525.00 to $1270.00 Also remember deductibles use to cost $250.00 now they cost $5000.00 \n\nStrange what use to cost in the 90s only $1400.00 a year now is over $3000.00\n\nAdd in the big 3 Auto/House Insurance even Property Taxes back in the 90s less then $2000.00 a year. Today just over $7000.00 \n\nSorry breaking we just got our Property Tax notice, 2 months ago they said if they didn't vote to increase them, it would be less then $100.00 increase. Sorry they were wrong up again, they gave us our Xmas present early almost another $500.00 increase. So those yearly cost up again almost $8000.00 \nAmazing when your House Insurance Agent says she had minor damage from Irma but she couldn't afford Insurance deductible of $5000.00. \n\nStrange many talk about scammers, many talk about Insurance Fraud...\n\nStrange when Government Agency's, even the Government Agency that over sees this type of activity refuses to help ones asking for help.\n\nWorst part there's no watchdog anymore."

It's one thing to say that there is a trend, it is another to say 0.51 is a \"strong predictive line\". \nNow the plot short of this linear curve fit was quite telling.

It ASSUMES - incorrectly - that liberals want to take decision making out of the hands of responsible individuals. That's not true.  Liberals want to take decision-making out of the hands of greedy corporations, many of whom have proven time and time again that, left to their own devices, they will lie, cheat and put the public health at risk for the sake of corporate profits.  Less regulation doesn't lead to human flourishing - it leads to corrupt business practices.  History tells us this.  That's why regulations were established in the first place."
